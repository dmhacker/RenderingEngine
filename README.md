## Specifications

* Recursive ray tracer
* Multithreaded (default number of threads = system cores)
* Uses Phong shading
* Support for ray reflection
* Support for camera translations (zoom)
* Support for spheres
* Support for triangular meshing
* Support for STL files
* Support for multiple light sources
* Optimized using balanced kd-tree
* 's' key takes picture of current render

## Future Improvements

* Use surface area heuristic (SAH) to produce a better kd-tree
* Vertex normal interpolation for mesh shading
* Camera rotation
* Support for refraction
